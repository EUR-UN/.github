## 📖 Before Asking for Help

## 🐛 Bug Reports & Feature Requests

For bugs or feature requests, please open an **Issue** in the relevant repository:

1. Go to the repository's **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Select the appropriate template (Bug Report / Feature Request).
4. Fill in all required fields with as much detail as possible.

> **Tip**: The more detail you provide (OS, versions, steps to reproduce), the faster we can help.

# Governance

This document describes the governance model for the **EUR-UN** open-source organization.

---

## Overview

EUR-UN is a small, agile open-source collective. We prioritize simplicity, transparency, and fast decision-making over bureaucratic process.

---

## Roles

### Organization Owner

The organization owner has full administrative access across all repositories and is responsible for:

- Setting the strategic direction of the organization
- Creating and archiving repositories
- Managing organization membership and team structures
- Approving cross-project architectural decisions
- Final authority on code of conduct enforcement

### Maintainer

Maintainers are trusted contributors with write access to one or more repositories. Responsibilities include:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues and managing project boards
- Ensuring code quality and CI/CD pipeline health
- Mentoring new contributors
- Releasing new versions

### Contributor

Anyone who contributes code, documentation, bug reports, or other improvements to any EUR-UN repository. Contributors:

- Follow the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Submit work via pull requests
- May be invited to become maintainers based on sustained, quality contributions

---

## Decision-Making

### Day-to-Day Decisions

- Maintainers make day-to-day decisions within their project scope (merge PRs, close issues, release versions).
- Decisions are made by **lazy consensus** — if no objection is raised within a reasonable time, the decision stands.

### Significant Decisions

For cross-project or architectural decisions:

1. A proposal is opened as a GitHub Issue with the `proposal` label.
2. Discussion period of at least **7 days**.
3. The organization owner makes the final call, taking community feedback into account.

### Examples of Significant Decisions

- Adding or removing repositories from the organization
- Changing the default license for new projects
- Modifying governance rules
- Granting or revoking maintainer access

---

## Project Lifecycle

### Incubation

New projects start as personal repositories. When a project:

- Has a clear README and documentation
- Has a permissive open-source license (MIT preferred)
- Aligns with the organization's focus areas
- Has at least one stable release

...it may be proposed for adoption into the EUR-UN organization.

### Active

Active projects receive regular maintenance, issue triage, and accept contributions.

### Maintenance Mode

Projects that are feature-complete but still receive bug fixes and security patches.

### Archived

Projects that are no longer maintained. They remain readable but accept no new contributions.

---

## Adding New Members

1. The candidate demonstrates sustained, quality contributions to one or more EUR-UN projects.
2. An existing maintainer or the organization owner nominates them.
3. The organization owner approves and grants appropriate access.

---

## Amendments

This governance document may be amended by the organization owner. Proposed changes will be posted as a PR with at least a 7-day comment period.
